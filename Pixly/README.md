# Pixly
Pixly is my A-Level coding project it is an ios application for artists to represent and show off their work to other like minded artists and to gain commition requests.   Only the main parts of my code will be on here so the assests and other things required to fully build it wont be here.

# Analysis

## -Problem Identification
Currently there is no individual platform for artists to create a portfolio to showcase their artwork exclusively without potentially being overshadowed by other content such as fitness and other genres unrelated to art. If an artist had all their work to show through an app with the ease of a username or link then it would make the process of representing art a lot easier. It could also allow businesses to search for genres of art and look to hire someone in that genre.
The features that the app will consist of is the ability to search for specific usernames and hashtags, it will also have a moodboard option with genre selection for artists to see other peoples arts in the same field of art to be able to obtain ideas.
Stakeholders
For the Stakeholders I initially sent out a survey to 16 art students to fill in to obtain generic data, only 6 people responded and the pi charts are in Survey Questionnaire from there I then picked 2 people to narrow down important ideas and implement them into the app and get rid of the ideas that aren't wanted by the majority.

### Interview
The interview starts with a survey for a broad audience within art to gather as much information as possible then a few members will be picked out, to ask for more detailed and more specific questions to get even more information to aid me in the User Interface, as well as features and other things they would like to see added to the app.

### Survey Questionnaire

For the questionnaire I sent out a survey to 16 art students to get information from artists to see what artists want and here's there questions and answers to the survey

#### Do you have a place to showcase your art portfolio online?

PUT THE REST OF THE PIE CHARTS HERE

As seen in the pie graphs the majority of artists who answered the questions favoured a very secure app with the possibility of arranging their portfolio as they see fit, They also would like to have the option of a website version so that they can access their portfolio on laptop or other devices. I also found out that having a watermark option for their artwork is also highly sought after as to prevent theft of art, they also liked the idea of templates for example a template on how their homepage would look like and/or templates on where the name of the art piece and the artists name would sit relative to enlarging the artwork to see in more detail.

## Interview
### Sarah
#### 1) What are some features you would like to see on a portfolio app?
> answer here
#### 2) With Watermarks being an option to add onto your artwork to prevent people stealing your work, do you think it should be placed in the bottom right automatically of give the artists the ability to place the watermark where they see fit e.g really big (maybe have no watermarks on profile page as they are small and downscaled but when you go to see the image at large have an opaque watermark of the artists name)
> answer here
#### 3) Would you put information such as education and real name in if there was an option to? (this is for businesses to see your education email and your actual name ect)

# Research
For Research there are a few apps around for specific things for artists an example of this is pinterest is really good for artists to use as a mood board, so what I came up with is to look at what these apps are doing good at and what i could use to improve on with my app, with my example of pinterest is having an page where you can put in a few tags and get shown some images which you can take a few and pin them on a mind map/mood board so artists can make an expandable page of art they like to use for inspiration

## Similar working solutions
- Instagram 
- Pinterest
- Linkedin
- Behance
- X (formerly known as Twitter)
- Pixiv

The closest things to this would be pinterest or linkedin however pinterest is more a mood board of inspiration for artists and linkedin is a little outdated and has no real way to present a digital portfolio of art. Another one would be instagram however there is a small art community and the rest is flooded with ‘instagram reels’ as well as fashion and other forms of content.

## Features of proposed solution
Portfolio app for artists to post all their art
Have username and name for easy search through either their actual name or their username
Set # for the genre e.g #horror, #animation with each post requiring at least 1 hashtag and allow to request a new hashtag
Only art being allowed 
Have info on their page like education and other things 
Maybe have the ability to follow maybe not
Person info will be optional so you aren’t forced to put your real name.
A page that has two rows of images pegged to a rack that can scroll and scrolling one will make the other scroll as they connect into a circle
A mind map board where you can take images you have added to the mood board and move them into groups and bubble said groups and organise this inspiration board as much as the user wants.

## Further meeting with stakeholders
Weekly basis with stakeholders day of the week tbc


# Requirements
# Software and Hardware requirements 
For coding I will be using a macbook as i will be coding in Xcode for its ease of use when it comes to building the app onto an iphone or ipad for testing purposes, as for the testing It will be on an Ipad as so i wont need for a phone emulator on the macbook but also it is much faster.(Fix Later)
Stakeholder requirements
Create any form of art that can be represented in a digital portfolio
